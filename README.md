# URL Shortener Service (TDD Project)

This repository contains a small **URL Shortener** service developed using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**.

## Status – Week 1 (Planning & Setup)

- Project skeleton created (folders, Node.js setup).
- Core unit tests are written to describe the expected behavior.
- **Implementation is intentionally missing** – functions currently throw `"Not implemented"`.
- As a result, **all tests are currently failing (RED phase)**, which is expected for Week 1.

## How to run locally

```bash
npm install
npm test   # tests will fail in Week 1 by design
